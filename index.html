        <h2>Sustainable Buying</h2>

        <p>Rocco</p>


        <p> I’ve been riding fixed gear bikes for the past 6 years, (first 4 on and off, last 2 fully involved in the matter) and I’ve always found myself stagnated at the time of buying for a new pair to destroy whilst on the bike. Last year I went to visit a good friends family house in Marbella, and his dad (he really my friend too) surprised me in the morning one day offering me a pair of Prada shoes (the ones that look like if some low Chucks had a baby with the highest quality leather Dunks you’ve ever seen, see attachment) that didn’t fit him and he got tired of. Of course I took them, nothing screams nice leather like that Prada red tag on the heel does. So far, they’ve been my daily uniform shoes (at least for the nicer weather days) mainly because of how well they perform on the track bike! I’ve been through heaven and hell in these shoes, I even took them to trackpacking from Rome to Naples as my odd pair (other pair was cycling shoes, and of course the trusty ‘ole Birkies[s.o. Brooklyn Birkie Boys]) 
            So yeah, I’d say these shoes were a great lesson on sustainable buying, buy good quality stuff that’ll last you longer than you’d expect it to, and you’ll be happy with the result.</p>

        <h2>Reflection on Inspiration</h2>

        <p>Malin</p>


        <p> Recently I feel like I’ve been able to see art and design in a more objective sense. By that, I mean that I don't feel like I ever need to 'wait' for inspiration to strike, and instead, I'm always ready to brainstorm and work through ideas and problems. Somewhat forcing inspiration is an essential part of a sustainable, repeatable creative process.
            I love the idea of basing a project around a found object. Michele and I sourced an old, ornate, metal tissue box from a friend of ours that was originally from an antique store. It was full of all these other antiquated objects like watches and lighters and small pieces of jewellery. A box full of memories. Memory, therefore, became the main focus of a short project.  
            We used the box we found, some electrical components, and some relatively simple code to create a memorisation game. Components included buttons, jumper cables, LED’s, a high-frequency buzzer, wire, cardboard and an Elegoo (an off-brand Arduino that works the same for a fraction of the cost).
            It’s comforting for me when art and design become inseparable. I feel like it’s essential to have a good understanding of complex technical mechanisms whilst giving yourself the freedom to take them apart, turn them inside out, destroy them, and rebuild them with not only a new form and function, but a new fundamental concept.</p>

       <h2>Collective Consciousness</h2>
       <p>Rocco</p>

        <p>Not long ago I read an article about German-American psychologist Wolfgang Köhler, who conducted a study in 1929 where they asked different populations (Tamil speakers in India, Tenerifeans, young children, infants, and American university students) to decide which shape fit “takete” and which fit “baluba”. 
            In all the cases, it was agreed that the shape with the rounded ends should be named “baluba”, and the shape with the sharp ends, “takete”. 
            I think It’s interesting to think, how natural our collective (in)consciousness actually is, and how design and ergonomy are fully rooted in these human brain tendencies. I guess we’re really humans after all.</p>
