        <h1>Fixies and Shoes</h1>

        <h2>Rocco</h2>

        <p>I’ve been riding fixed gear bikes for the past 6 years, (first 4 on and off, last 2 fully involved in the matter) and I’ve always found myself stagnated at the time of buying for a new pair to destroy whilst on the bike. Last year I went to visit a good friends family house in Marbella, and his dad (he really my friend too) surprised me in the morning one day offering me a pair of Prada shoes (the ones that look like if some low Chucks had a baby with the highest quality leather Dunks you’ve ever seen, see attachment) that didn’t fit him and he got tired of. Of course I took them, nothing screams nice leather like that Prada red tag on the heel does. So far, they’ve been my daily uniform shoes (at least for the nicer weather days) mainly because of how well they perform on the track bike! I’ve been through heaven and hell in these shoes, I even took them to trackpacking from Rome to Naples as my odd pair (other pair was cycling shoes, and of course the trusty ‘ole Birkies[s.o. Brooklyn Birkie Boys])</p>
